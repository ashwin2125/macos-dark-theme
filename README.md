### Tweaks & theming

If you want to play around with new colors, use the setting
`workbench.colorCustomizations` to customize the currently selected theme. For
example, you can add this snippet in your "settings.json" file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "workbench.iconTheme": "material-icon-theme",
  "editor.cursorBlinking": "expand",
  "editor.cursorSmoothCaretAnimation": true,
  "editor.mouseWheelZoom": true
}
```
or use the setting `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`

### Backstory

I've always searched for a better color theme that would be absolutely dark and tidy. I wasn't able to find any, that suited my personal taste. Then came the thought  _"Why not just create and publish one, Ashwin?"_

Andddd, thats where **"MacOS Dark Theme"** came into existence. 

I request everyone to try the theme, hope you all like it.
